# Overview

This project is a soccer/football lineup builder. It is currently a work-in-progress. It will allow the user to select a lineup of players for a hypothetical team.

While building it, I hope to learn more about TypeScript and demonstrate TypeScript features.

# Development Environment

To use TypeScript, you can install it globally through npm with the following command:

`npm install -g typescript`

It is also possible to install TypeScript on a per-project basis:

`npm install typescript --save-dev`

Then you can generate a tsconfig.json file by entering the following in the terminal:

`tsc --init`

To compile, enter `tsc` in the terminal. This will generate a .js file. Alternatively, if you want to recompile every time changes are made, enter `tsc -w` in the terminal.

# Future Work

Eventually, I would like the program to allow the user to select from an assortment of player "cards," and drag and drop them onto a field to visually represent the formation and lineup.
